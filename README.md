# Web Scraping using Python - Booking.com
## Project Overview
This project is a web scraping application that extracts hotel details from [Booking.com](https://www.booking.com/index.en-gb.html?label=gen173nr-1BCAEoggI46AdIM1gEaGyIAQGYAQm4ARfIAQzYAQHoAQGIAgGoAgO4AtbN770GwAIB0gIkOGE5ZTJkOWQtNmNmZi00N2M3LThmYzktMWU5NTk3YzY2Zjk22AIF4AIB&sid=3d09adecee66e77e25fa12ed8bf3511c&aid=304142). It gathers information such as hotel name, price, location, ratings, reviews, and booking links for a specified city and date range. The collected data is then saved as a CSV file in the local directory.
## Objectives
1. **Automate Hotel Data Collection** ‚Äì Extract key details from Booking.com efficiently.
2. **Flexible Scraping** ‚Äì Allow users to input a URL and filename for custom searches.
3. **Data Storage** ‚Äì Save extracted hotel details in a structured CSV format.
4. **Error Handling & Performance** ‚Äì Implement sleep timers and request headers for smooth scraping.
5. **User-Friendly Execution** ‚Äì Provide a seamless command-line experience for users.
## Technologies & Libraries Used
- Python 3.x
- BeautifulSoup4 ‚Äì This is for parsing HTML and extracting hotel details.
- Requests ‚Äì For sending HTTP requests to Booking.com.
- CSV ‚Äì To store extracted data in a structured format.
- LXML ‚Äì For fast and efficient HTML parsing.

   - Hotel Name üè®
   - Price üí∞
   - Location üìç
   - Rating ‚≠ê
   - Review Count üìù
   - Booking Link üîó
